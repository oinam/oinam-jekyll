$ gem push oinam-jekyll-x.x.x.gem
```

## Todo

- [ ] Style Tables
- [ ] Split the CSS and Javascript on their own files, the inclusion or exclusion should be user defined. Make it an optional config setting.
- [ ] Demo: Themes / Color Scheme Preview?
- [ ] Split Styles into more cleaner separation -- base, grid, gallery, etc.
- [ ] Fix Gallery
- [ ] Remove any enforcements such as YouTube embeds. Keep the code for backward compatibility?
- [ ] Lunr for Search as default?
- [ ] Print Styles based off Gutenberg (or pick something that does not depend on normalize). Add this theme specific styles.
- [ ] Reading progress on top bar.
- [ ] Look at [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) for the layout, styles, and especially that Sidenotes/Footnotes.
- [x] Spit out the Styles separate so it can just be referenced on its own from a simple HTML site.
- [x] Toggle description in the header.
